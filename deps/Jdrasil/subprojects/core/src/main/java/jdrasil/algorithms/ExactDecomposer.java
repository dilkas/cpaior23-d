 * Using call() will invoke the following:
 *   a) the graph will be reduced by preprocessing
 *   b) and upper bound will be computed by stochastic-min fill
 *   c) a lower bound will be computed by minor-min-width
 *   d) if ub == lb the computation is done
 *   e) if n^ub is smaller then some threshold the optimal solution will be computed by the dynamic cops-and-robber game
 *   f) otherwise the optimal solution will be computed by a SAT-Encoding, either serial or parallel
 *
 * It is assumed that the graph is connected.
