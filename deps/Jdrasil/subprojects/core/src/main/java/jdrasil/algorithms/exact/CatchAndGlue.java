/**
 * Tree width has nice game theoretic characterisations, one of which is the node-search game played by a set of searchers and
 * a fugitive. The variant of the game that corresponds to tree width is the one with a visible fugitive of unbounded speed
 * (also known as the helicopter cops and robber game, defined by Robertson and Seymour).
 *
 * This class computes a winning strategy for the cops (from which a tree decomposition can be deduced) in a bottom-up fashion.
 * In order to do so, a queue of win-configurations is maintained which is pre-filled with trivial win-configurations, i.e.,
 * configurations in which the robber will be caught immediately.
 * Then predecessor configurations (with respect to a winning strategy of the cops) are computed for the configurations
 * in the queue, and if these configurations are win-configurations as well, they are added back to queue.
 * As larger win-configurations are "better" in the sense that we wish to find a win-configuration for the whole graph,
 * a priority queue is used that orders configurations by size.
 *
 * Computing predecessor configurations is straighted forward if the cops move does not disconnect the graph
 * (i.e. a simple existential "fly"-move), however, it is difficult if a universal "split"-move is reconstructed
 * (i.e., if the current configuration of the game originated from a cops move that has disconnected the graph and
 * from a corresponding robber move whom has chosen a connected component). In this scenario multiple win-configurations
 * (which we may or may not already have discovered) have to be glued together. These configurations correspond to branch
 * nodes in the tree decomposition.
 *
 * The "glue"-part of the algorithm is inspired by the work of Hisao Tamaki for the PACE 2016. He used this strategy
 * to implement a bottom-up version of the algorithm of Arnborg et al., which is based on similar ideas as the node-search
 * game.
